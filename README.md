# Results and Analysis
 What can you say about the frequencies of neutral, positive and negative words after the analysis?
 Result- After seeing the plot of the word cloud of the positive, negative and neutral words we can clearly see that the        frequency of the neutral and positive words is much greater than the negative words. So, we can say that the           overall sentiments of tourists towards rajasthan is positive i.e good.

What can we conclude from the number of tweets made on the three different days?
Result- Here, after the data preprocessing the number of relevant tweets left to analyse were 281. After seeing the plot of frequency vs number of tweets, we can see that there is a drastic increase in the no. of tweets on day 2. So, we can conclude by this that there must have been an event or a holiday on that particular day because of which people are tweeting more about Rajasthan Tourism. So, this on a larger scale can be helpful for the state government for the purpose of resource management for that particular time period and prepare well in advance.
