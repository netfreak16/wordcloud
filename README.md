# Word Cloud Generator: Sentiment Based


Created a Word Cloud in which size of each word depends on the frequency of words in the tweets and colour based on its sentiment to study the Travelers Experience.

# Contribution

 Collected twitter data of \#RajasthanTravels and used TextBlob and other Python Libraries for data wrangling and final sentimental analysis. 

# Results and Analysis
* Green color words : Positive Sentiments
* White color words : Neutral Sentiments
* Red color words : Negative Sentiments

 What can you say about the frequencies of neutral, positive and negative words after the analysis? <br />
 Result- After seeing the plot of generated word cloud we can clearly see that the frequency of the neutral and positive words is much greater than the negative words. So, we can say that the           overall sentiments of tourists towards rajasthan is positive i.e good.

What can we conclude from the number of tweets made on the three different days? <br />
Result- On analysing the plot of frequency vs number of tweets, we can observe that there is a drastic increase in the no. of tweets on day 2. So, we can conclude by this that there must have been an event or a holiday on that particular day because of which there was an increased flow of tourists with more of them tweeting about Rajasthan Tourism. So, this on a larger scale can be helpful for the state government for the purpose of resource management for that particular time period and prepare well in advance based on previous year data.
